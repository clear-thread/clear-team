# Test Case: ClearThread (Vedai) - The Cognitive Coach

## Product Description
ClearThread (formerly Vedai) is an AI-driven analysis platform consisting of a Chrome extension and web platform. It automates complex web content analysis to provide "Signal Dominance." It features a "Cognitive Coach" and a "Signal Lens" that offers three modes: Focus (Mute noise), Lens (Reveal intent), and Off (Standard reading).

## Technical Context
- **Stack:** Gemini 1.5 Flash, Vertex AI, Google Cloud Run, PostgreSQL.
- **Problem:** Users are overwhelmed by "information saturation," "narrative spin," and "emotional adjectives" in digital media.

## Strategic Goal
Transform ClearThread from a "utility tool" into a "strategic necessity" by leveraging AI to give users an "unfair cognitive advantage"—a high-status signal.

## Deliverables
1. **Strategic Payoff Matrix**: Compare the "Noise-Heavy" status quo vs. "Signal-Dominance" with ClearThread.
2. **Evolutionary Motivation Analysis**: Identify the primal drivers for adopting a "Cognitive Coach."
3. **Cognitive Simplification**: Refine the "Signal in the Spin" narrative for maximum fluency.
