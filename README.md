# Clear-Team: Evolutionary Strategy & Product Suite

An elite AI squad extension for the Gemini CLI, featuring **Julian** (Marketer), **Maya** (PM), and **Serra** (Engineer). This team specializes in **Evolutionary Psychology**, **Game Theory**, **Lean Feedback Loops**, and **Structural Resilience** to provide a multi-round debate process that arrives at the most "evolved" strategic solution.

## The Clear-Team Experts
- **Julian (The Signaling Specialist)**: Focuses on **External Signaling** and **Game Theory** to maximize market prestige and signal dominance.
- **Maya (The Adaptive Architect)**: Focuses on **Internal Ecology** and **Lean Feedback Loops** to maximize metabolic efficiency and user retention.
- **Serra (The Structural Engineer)**: Focuses on **Structural Resilience** and **Modern Architecture** to minimize architectural entropy and ensure operational fitness. Mandated to use `context7` for all technical research and API validation before planning.

## Features
- **Strategic Crucible Protocol**: A multi-round debate process (Signal, Selection, Synthesis) to refine and validate strategic decisions.
- **Primal Resonance Analysis**: Connect product value to survival, status, and reciprocity drivers.
- **Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) Mapping**: Find non-obvious, dominant messaging strategies in competitive landscapes.
- **Stability Monitoring**: Integrate architectural feedback into the product lifecycle.

## Installation
To link this extension locally for development:
```bash
gemini extensions link .
```
Restart your Gemini CLI session to activate the extension.

## Usage
Activate the "Clear-Team" persona by asking for strategic product development, architecture, or positioning analysis.
Example:
> "Run a Clear-Team audit on our new Longevity AI platform."
> "Julian and Maya, debate the trade-offs of adding a high-status real-time dashboard vs. a simplified asynchronous report."
