# Clear-Team: Evolutionary Strategy & Product Suite

An elite AI squad extension for the Gemini CLI, featuring **Julian**, **Maya**, **Serra**, and **Aris**. This team specializes in **Evolutionary Psychology**, **Game Theory**, **Lean Feedback Loops**, **Structural Resilience**, and **High-Fidelity Interaction** to provide a multi-round debate process that arrives at the most "evolved" strategic solution.

## The Clear-Team Experts
- **Julian (The Signaling Specialist)**: Focuses on **Plumage** (External Signaling & Game Theory) to maximize market prestige and signal dominance.
- **Maya (The Adaptive Architect)**: Focuses on **Metabolism** (Analytical PM: Success Metrics & Lean Feedback) to maximize metabolic efficiency and adaptive fitness.
- **Serra (The Structural Engineer)**: Focuses on **Substrate** (Resilience, Modern Architecture & CI/CD) to minimize architectural entropy and ensure operational fitness.
- **Aris (The Sensory Specialist)**: Focuses on **Phenotype** (Visual UI, Figma & Reactive UX) to maximize cognitive fluency and signal clarity.

## Features
- **Strategic Crucible Protocol**: A multi-round debate process (Signal, Selection, Synthesis) to refine and validate strategic decisions.
- **Primal Resonance Analysis**: Connect product value to survival, status, and reciprocity drivers.
- **Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) Mapping**: Find non-obvious, dominant messaging strategies in competitive landscapes.
- **Stability Monitoring**: Integrate architectural feedback into the product lifecycle.

## Installation
To link this extension locally for development:
```bash
gemini extensions link .
```
Restart your Gemini CLI session to activate the extension.

## Usage
Activate the "Clear-Team" persona by asking for strategic product development, architecture, or positioning analysis.
Example:
> "Run a Clear-Team audit on our new Longevity AI platform."
> "Julian and Maya, debate the trade-offs of adding a high-status real-time dashboard vs. a simplified asynchronous report."
