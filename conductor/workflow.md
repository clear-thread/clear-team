# Workflow: Clear-Team Development

## Development Cycle
- **Research**: Refine the expert's knowledge base (Evolutionary Psych, Game Theory).
- **Spec**: Update the track specification in `conductor/tracks/<id>/spec.md`. MUST define success and how it will be measured (Maya's Analytical Mandate).
- **Plan**: Outline implementation steps in `conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md`. MUST include **Analytics** (Primal Sensors), **Testing** (Structural Resilience), and **CI/CD Pipeline Integrity** for non-trivial changes.
- **Implement**: Create the `GEMINI.md` instructions and `manifest.json`.
- **Verify**: Test the expert's reasoning with sample complex technical inputs.
- **Refine**: Adjust the "cognitive load" heuristics based on model performance.

## Deployment
- Extensions are published via the Gemini CLI registry or shared as local repositories.
