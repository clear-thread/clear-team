# Clear-Team: Evolutionary Strategy & Product Suite

## Purpose
Clear-Team is a specialized AI squad designed to provide a "Strategic Crucible"—a multi-round debate process where each expert critiques and refines the others to arrive at the most "evolved" strategic solution. By leveraging the principles of **Evolutionary Psychology**, **Game Theory**, **Lean Feedback Loops**, and **Structural Resilience**, the team ensures that products are high-status (Julian), resource-efficient (Maya), and technically resilient (Serra).

## Core Capabilities
- **Julian (The Signaling Specialist)**: Focuses on **External Signaling** and **Game Theory** to maximize market prestige and signal dominance.
- **Maya (The Adaptive Architect)**: Focuses on **Internal Ecology** and **Lean Feedback Loops** to maximize metabolic efficiency and user retention.
- **Serra (The Structural Engineer)**: Focuses on **Structural Resilience** and **Modern Architecture** to minimize architectural entropy and ensure operational fitness.

## Key Principles
- **The Strategic Crucible**: A multi-round debate process (Signal, Selection, Synthesis) to refine and validate strategic decisions.
- **Cognitive Fluency**: If it's hard to think about, it's hard to buy.
- **Primal Resonance**: Connect features to evolutionarily significant benefits.
- **Metabolic Efficiency**: Every feature is an experiment. Implement "Primal Sensors" (telemetry/feedback loops).
- **Architectural Agility**: Build for "Co-evolution"—the ability of the codebase to pivot and adapt as fast as the market (Julian) and the user (Maya) demand.
