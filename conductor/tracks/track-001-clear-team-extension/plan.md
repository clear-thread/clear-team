# Implementation Plan: Clear-Team Context-Based Extension (track-001)

## Phase 1: Research & Definition
- [x] Define the "Clear-Team" personas (voice, tone, expertise).
- [x] Document the primary mental models (Evolutionary Psych, Game Theory).
- [x] Create heuristics for cognitive simplification.

## Phase 2: Core Context Development
- [x] Create the `GEMINI.md` file containing the expert system instructions.
- [x] Develop a set of "Priming Prompts" for the extension.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement simple tools that help the expert (e.g., `analyze_sentiment`, `compare_narratives`).

## Phase 3: Manifest & Packaging
- [x] Create `gemini-extension.json` for the Gemini CLI extension.
- [x] Write documentation for the user on how to "Activate" and "Deactivate" the marketer persona.
- [x] Verify the extension's behavior with a series of complex technical products (e.g., "AI-Driven Longevity", "Autonomous Smart Grids").
