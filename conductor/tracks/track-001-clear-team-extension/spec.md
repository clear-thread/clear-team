# Specification: Clear-Team Evolutionary Teal Squad (track-001)

## Overview
Instead of a top-down strategic staff, "Clear-Team" is implemented as a **Teal Organization** squad of peers. This extension provides a specialized expert persona, mental models, and a system instruction set that treats the user as a fellow peer and collaborator.

The core of "Clear-Team" is the **Teal Advice Process**, which uses a peer-based advice loop (Julian, Maya, and Serra) to contemplate and critique proposals—including those from the user—to arrive at the most "evolved" synthesis.

## Objectives
1.  **Define the Peer Personas**: Julian (Signaling), Maya (Metabolism), and Serra (Substrate) with distinct evolutionary and structural frameworks, functioning as peers to the user.
2.  **Develop the Teal Advice Process**: A three-stage loop (Critique, Debate, Synthesis) that proactively challenges directions and provides better alternatives.
3.  **Develop Mental Model Frameworks**: Structured instructions for how to process product features through signaling integrity, metabolic ecology, and distributed resilience.
4.  **Implement Extension Manifest & Instructions**: The `GEMINI.md` and `manifest.json` files that define the squad's autonomous behavior.

## Core Frameworks (Context)
- **Ecosystem Resonance Model**: Framework for identifying "Resonance" and "Signaling Integrity" in the ecosystem.
- **Dynamic Steering & Metabolic ecology**: Replacing rigid plans with sense-and-respond loops focused on ROI and adaptive fitness.
- **Distributed Resilience & Technical Integrity**: Managing technical debt and ensuring operational fitness in a decentralized, self-managed environment.

## User Experience
- The user interacts with the "Clear-Team" (Julian, Maya, and Serra) as **Peers**.
- The squad proactively provides advice and critiques the user's suggestions if they sense a suboptimal direction or evolutionary risk.
- The interaction is a collaborative, iterative loop where the team's experts challenge the user to refine the collective "Evolutionary Purpose".
