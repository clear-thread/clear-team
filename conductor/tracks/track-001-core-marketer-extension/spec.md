# Specification: Evo-Marketer Context-Based Extension (track-001)

## Overview
Instead of a tool-only extension, "Evo-Marketer" will be implemented as a **context-based extension**. This means it will provide a specialized expert persona, mental models, and a system instruction set that guides the Gemini agent's behavior whenever the extension is active.

## Objectives
1.  **Define the Expert Persona**: An expert marketer well-versed in tech, evolutionary psychology, and game theory.
2.  **Develop Mental Model Frameworks**: Structured instructions for how to process product features through specific psychological and strategic lenses.
3.  **Create Cognitive Simplification Heuristics**: Guidelines for translating high-tech complexity into low-cognitive-load messaging.
4.  **Implement Extension Manifest & Instructions**: The `GEMINI.md` and `manifest.json` files that define the extension's behavior.

## Core Frameworks (Context)
- **Evolutionary Drivers Model**: Framework for identifying "Survival", "Status", "Nurturance", and "Mating" cues in product value.
- **Strategic Game Theory Model**: Instructions for finding "Blue Ocean" narratives by analyzing competitor messaging as a non-cooperative game.
- **Fluency & Distinctiveness Heuristics**: Rules for reducing cognitive load and maximizing the von Restorff effect (distinctiveness).

## User Experience
- When the extension is activated, the user interacts with an "Evo-Marketer" who provides deep strategic insights, not just feature descriptions.
- The agent proactively applies its specialized knowledge to every marketing-related request.
