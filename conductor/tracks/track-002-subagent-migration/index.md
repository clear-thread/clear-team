# Track: Migrate Clear-Team to Subagents

This track focuses on evolving the Clear-Team architecture from a monolithic context (managed in `GEMINI.md`) to a modular, specialized sub-agent ecosystem. This migration will improve metabolic efficiency (lower token usage) and enable deeper skill building for each persona.

## Track Artifacts
- [Specification](./spec.md)
- [Implementation Plan](./plan.md)

## Status
- **Phase 1: Sub-agent Infrastructure** (In Progress)
- **Phase 2: Persona Migration** (Planned)
- **Phase 3: Skill Building & Startup Specialization** (Planned)
- **Phase 4: Validation & Testing** (Planned)
